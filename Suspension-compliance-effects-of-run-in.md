## Suspension compliance & effects of run-in. Observations,Notes,Thoughts.
*Author: Matthew Morgan J*

Not posting this to start another heated discussion about preconditioning (run-in or break-in) but preconditioning was used here to demonstrate the fact that a higher suspension compliance (higher Vas for a given Sd) with a lower Qes & Fs value can benefit a Paraflex cabinet *within reason*.  
This information gives us a few more factors to consider (along with some very important ones like motor force) when attempting to choose the best driver for your Paraflex project  (or gives us some guidance when it comes to the decisions which must be made when having a custom driver built for your Paraflex project) 

### The test subject here is a 21NLW9601 from 18Sound 
After 4 to 6 hours of a 20hz signal in free-air the driver's Fs value has shifted nearly 10hz and is approaching the driver's published Fs figure.
The Qes & Qts will have shifted down quite a lot while the driver's Vas will have increased

The driver was preconditioned in free-air for around a total of 9 hours before our friend installed the driver back into the cabinet to take the "after" measurement which is shown as the white trace (as opposed to the "before" curve which is magenta) 

All measurement conditions remain exactly the same and you can see that there is a little gain in sensitivity between 35hz to 80hz -ish 
The cabinet used here is a custom Paraflex C-2E 1x21 without the angle-brace update  (it is a standard C-2E, not Golden Formula series, so the loading here is moderate)

### NOTES
---

What we have found out about compliance and our Paraflex cabinets has me taking this aspect into consideration more than I have in a long time.

Recently i was comparing the Vas values (suspension compliance among drivers with the same cone area) and I realized that among all of our favorite 21" drivers which we regularly recommend for Paraflex subwoofers the 4 ohm version of Matteo Bianchini's 21NTLW5000 from 18sound has the highest Vas figure of them all with the 8 ohm version of the driver very close behind. .... This is a stark contrast from the 21NLW9601's relatively tight suspension.

This makes me extremely curious about the amount of benefit we will see from this higher suspension compliance in our Golden Formula Paraflex C-2A 1x21 or our Silver Formula Paraflex C-2E subwoofer, and will it be of more benefit than the 9601's stronger motor?? ðŸ¤”
I have no doubt that the NTLW5000 will handle more long term average power without running hot but might it's characteristics also give us the bonus of increased subbass sensitivity in our cabinets? (relative to the 9601)

When it comes to our Paraflex subwoofers motor force certainly is important but we have found that a compliant suspension also improves performance, and yes these are all indicated by the driver's T/S parameters (and for the characteristics I have mentioned here Vas, BL, Re and Le are of particular interest to us) 

### Note 2
Here is another demonstration below, although this is two improvements stacked so not entirely scientific but nevertheless very exciting! What we are looking at here real-world "before" (yellow) & "after" (green) measurements of the Paraflex Golden Formula C-2A 1x21 loaded with a fresh 21NLW9601 versus conditioned 21NLW9601 (more compliant suspension, it is the very same driver after break-in)

The other change made here was the implementation of the angle-brace update
These measurements are taken by Ben Wells under the very same conditions, and he says he repeated taking the "after" measurements multiple times to make sure what he was seeing is correct (being that this is such a surprisingly large gain we can understand why he wanted more than one verification
