### THERMAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN SUBWOOFER SYSTEMS (HOQS - PARAFLEX)
*Author Matthew Morgan J*

### Preface
Lets talk about strategies to manage thermal buildup (heat) on the motors of your subwoofers in a PA rig being played at party levels+ for the entire duration of long gigs. It is primarily (and most importantly) a matter of having enough subwoofers to keep up with your tops but there are some related details which are also worth mentioning.

I will start off by saying that since Paraflex cabinet designs often make the driver's motor easily accessible for touching it means this feature allows us to be more aware of the magnet structure's heat status (which is also the case with many Tapped Horn cabinet designs). This is very different from FLH Folded Horn subwoofers or Scoops (or many other common cabinet types for that matter). So most users of traditional Folded Horns or Scoops are largely oblivious to just how scorching hot their driver's motor may become when subjected to sustained high average power levels.

**"Out of sight out of mind" right?? iGnOrAnCe iS bLiSs right??**

Well no, that sucks balls like expired boba tea, we are better than that, how about lets just Raw Dog life with a high level of awareness so we can resolve our issues.
Face our demons!Lets grab the bull by the horns!  Sound transformatively good to you? Ready to grow & evolve?

### Reliably withstand & perform in a highly taxing challing scenario
In the following texts we will establish some rough guidelines to follow for the purpose of creating a PA speaker system which can reliably withstand & perform in a highly taxing & challenging (yet not uncommon) scenario without suffering from excessive thermal compression losses and without burning up or damaging drivers.  

This worst case scenario will be described below, and we will delve into how voicecoil size & quantity are important, as well as the number of cabinets, type, size and ratio. 
There is something to be said about excursion minimums with associated electrical impedance features and how a correlation of these contribute to current draw with heat generation. **We will also touch upon limiter settings** Many who have built and or own the Paraflex 1x12 or 2x12 tops can tell you that they are very capable PA mid-tops which can keep up with multiple subwoofer cabinets.

In fact if you take a single one of our Paraflex 2x12 tops and use it with a single Paraflex 1x18 subwoofer you will find that it will be fine at low to moderate levels but when you push this little system to raucous party volume the subwoofer will at some point begin to show signs of heat buildup on the motor (or some other form of strain) before the 2x12 top even begins to approach it's limits, and this simply means we have an imbalance of available headroom.

This imbalance is exacerbated when the music being played is a very bass-heavy style with a Low Crest factor (meaning a high average level, dynamically compressed) and sustained basslines having fundamentals (sines) located on & around the frequencies in which the subwoofer's Electrical Impedance minimums & Excursion minimums coincide, this is the "worst case scenario" which i promised to describe earlier. 


### Recipe for thermal problems
If the music that you play happens to have droning basslines focused heavily at 35hz then making the mistake of selecting a subwoofer cabinet which has it's fundamental tuned to 35hz will be a recipe for thermal problems. We can avoid this for the most part by having the cabinet tuned a bit lower.

Our Paraflex Silver Formula C-2E or the C-2E.3 (which can easily be adapted for a 21") or the original C-2E 1x21 are all tuned fairly low and the angle-brace update can be implemented with them.  
The Paraflex C-2E 2x15 also has a lower tuning option in the plans. The Paraflex CRAM! 2x15 such as the one Bradley Steven Katz built is tuned low as well. 

Referring again to the media section of this post; be sure to take a look at the peak-hold spectral analysis charts which have been provided, these show the spectral distribution of energy in some very bass-heavy tracks. Make note of where the bassline's energy is centered and also make note of the difference in amplitude when referenced to the level at 90hz, 20dB , 19dB , and 17dB are all massive discrepancies in amplitude, and even a more conservative 15dB suggests a power multiplication factor of 32 which in-theory means if we are crossing over from our subwoofers to our tops around 80hz or 90hz our subwoofer system would need to handle 32 times more power than our PA tops (to make up for the 15db difference) if we want to play this sort of music at very high levels without our subwoofers running out of steam (headroom) before our tops reach their maximum output capability.

This of course suggests that we are going to need a heck of a lot of subwoofers to keep up with only one or two of our tops when playing such bass heavy music at very high levels, HOWEVER, It is true that we will need a lot of subwoofers for extreme SPL but not to worry as it is not quite as outlandish as our line of reasoning with this example suggests.  
As opposed to the figures given here our real-world is more forgiving in practice **More practical** 10 decibels is much closer to what we really need to make up for in the critical high SPL application, 10dB is a power multiplication factor of 10 (Easy to remember)

*Note that the the type of music you play, and at what level, and for how long, are all determining factors in this but the following ratio recommendations will be based on our "worst case" heavy-bass low Crest-Factor high SPL scenario discussed above.*

### RECOMMENDED CABINET RATIO GUIDE
---
**A way to figure out what you need is by following some rough Top-To-Subwoofer Ratio guidelines which are as follows:**  
A single Paraflex 1x12 top (G#1 STYLE) = 1:3 ratio if using Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers or a 1:2 ratio if using our Paraflex 1x21 or 2x15 subwoofers with recommended drivers. In other words if you are running a pair of these 1x12 tops you can have 6 of our Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers or 4 of our 1x21 (or 2x15) subwoofers which should bring you close enough to matching your available headroom.  

Paraflex 2x12 top = Referring to the ratios given above for the 1x12 you can double the amount of subwoofers when using the Paraflex 2x12 top.
Two of our Paraflex Type "A" 1x12 subwoofers loaded with recommended robust drivers are nearly equivalent to one of our Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers. 
Three of these Type "A" 1x12 subwoofers is nearly equivalent to 1 of our Paraflex 1x21 subwoofer cabinets or a Paraflex 2x15 subwoofer. The drivers which are used in these cabinets will of course make a difference so these ratios are only approximations.
Two of our Paraflex 1x15 subwoofers are equivalent-ish to a Paraflex 1x21 subwoofer (again the drivers used will influence this). 
The Paraflex 2x8 top loaded with capable 8" drivers will be nearly equivalent to the Paraflex 1x12 (G#1 style) Top. If high passed a bit higher it will gain some headroom, or when used with kickbins it will gain headroom.

So that covers the ratios, just know that they are not set in stone and they are not entirely precise but they are useful for the sake of guidance & perspective.
These ratios can assist you in making informed decisions when it comes to how you invest in your system as the matching of headroom means your money is more effectively spent due to the way you are intelligently allocating it. (highly important when resources are limited)


### BENDING THE CABINET RATIOS
---
If you would like to skew the ratios in a way which calls for a few less subwoofers in your system then you can certainly do this by choosing drivers with higher power handling capability for your subwoofer cabinets, or by choosing a Paraflex subwoofer cabinet design which employs multiple drivers. 
Generally speaking this means larger diameter voicecoils or it can mean more voicecoils per cabinet (or 18Sound's Tetracoil). A superb example of this (which has been built in multiples and is practical) would be the Paraflex C-2E 2x15 subwoofer loaded with dual 15DS115 drivers (there is an adaptation in which we shift the driver's baffles over slightly for the 15DS115s in order to give their pole vents a little more breathing room), it is a marvelous combination with tremendous power density for a Paraflex. 
A few less radical & less costly examples could be one of the NTL5000 drivers in the Silver Formula C-2E subwoofer or one of the 6" diameter coiled 21" drivers such as the NSW6021-6 or 21SW152 in the Silver Formula C-2E or Golden Formula C-2A 1x21.  

### LESS CAN BE MORE WHEN IT COMES TO PROCESSING
---
It is important to mention that Paraflex subwoofer systems tend to sound best and perform optimally with very little processing (or no processing at all, other than recommended High-Pass and Low-Pass filters) on the subwoofer channel.
In other words we recommend keeping the processing minimal which means that some of the classic hardware such as the BBE Sonic Maximizer or Aphex Aural Exciter are not needed and this is a great opportunity to simplify your amplifier rack (perhaps open up enough room for another amplifier).  

This recommendation is not only for the sake of improved sound quality but anything which takes away from the dynamics of your low frequency content while boosting the average level of low frequency energy in the vicinity of your subwoofer cabinet's fundamental tuning increases the potential for thermal buildup. 

This of course does not apply to what a DJ must do on their side when the occasional anemic sounding track is encountered and some fattening up of the track's bottom-end is required. This is acceptable since it is selectively applied and only when called for.

###  BE DILIGENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PREVENTION OF CLIPPING
---
This is a good place for mentioning how important it is to make sure none of the stages in your signal chain are being overloaded because if any component in your chain is pushed much too hard it becomes a source of clipped waveforms (flat topping) which as you should know are notorious for overheating voicecoils.  
If your DJ is blasting the mixer's output level meters into the red then you need to take action in order to prevent that from happening. Make up for it with additional gain in your system's latter stages if necessary. Keep a spray bottle or squirt gun handy so you can squirt the DJ every time they hit the reds as if you are training an unruly kitten. Be consistent, show no mercy!
