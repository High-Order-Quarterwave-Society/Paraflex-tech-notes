### THERMAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN SUBWOOFER SYSTEMS (HOQS - PARAFLEX)
*Author Matthew Morgan J*

---
### Preface
Lets talk about strategies to manage thermal buildup (heat) on the motors of your subwoofers in a PA rig being played at party levels+ for the entire duration of long gigs. It is primarily (and most importantly) a matter of having enough subwoofers to keep up with your tops but there are some related details which are also worth mentioning.

I will start off by saying that since Paraflex cabinet designs often make the driver's motor easily accessible for touching it means this feature allows us to be more aware of the magnet structure's heat status (which is also the case with many Tapped Horn cabinet designs). This is very different from FLH Folded Horn subwoofers or Scoops (or many other common cabinet types for that matter). So most users of traditional Folded Horns or Scoops are largely oblivious to just how scorching hot their driver's motor may become when subjected to sustained high average power levels.

### Reliably withstand & perform in a highly taxing challing scenario
In the following texts we will establish some rough guidelines to follow for the purpose of creating a PA speaker system which can reliably withstand & perform in a highly taxing & challenging (yet not uncommon) scenario without suffering from excessive thermal compression losses and without burning up or damaging drivers.  

This worst case scenario will be described below, and we will delve into how voicecoil size & quantity are important, as well as the number of cabinets, type, size and ratio. 
There is something to be said about excursion minimums with associated electrical impedance features and how a correlation of these contribute to current draw with heat generation. **We will also touch upon limiter settings** Many who have built and or own the Paraflex 1x12 or 2x12 tops can tell you that they are very capable PA mid-tops which can keep up with multiple subwoofer cabinets.

In fact if you take a single one of our Paraflex 2x12 tops and use it with a single Paraflex 1x18 subwoofer you will find that it will be fine at low to moderate levels but when you push this little system to raucous party volume the subwoofer will at some point begin to show signs of heat buildup on the motor (or some other form of strain) before the 2x12 top even begins to approach it's limits, and this simply means we have an imbalance of available headroom.

This imbalance is exacerbated when the music being played is a very bass-heavy style with a Low Crest factor (meaning a high average level, dynamically compressed) and sustained basslines having fundamentals (sines) located on & around the frequencies in which the subwoofer's Electrical Impedance minimums & Excursion minimums coincide, this is the "worst case scenario" which i promised to describe earlier. 


### Recipe for thermal problems
If the music that you play happens to have droning basslines focused heavily at 35hz then making the mistake of selecting a subwoofer cabinet which has it's fundamental tuned to 35hz will be a recipe for thermal problems. We can avoid this for the most part by having the cabinet tuned a bit lower.

Our Paraflex Silver Formula C-2E or the C-2E.3 (which can easily be adapted for a 21") or the original C-2E 1x21 are all tuned fairly low and the angle-brace update can be implemented with them.  
The Paraflex C-2E 2x15 also has a lower tuning option in the plans. The Paraflex CRAM! 2x15 such as the one Bradley Steven Katz built is tuned low as well. 

Referring again to the media section of this post; be sure to take a look at the peak-hold spectral analysis charts which have been provided, these show the spectral distribution of energy in some very bass-heavy tracks. Make note of where the bassline's energy is centered and also make note of the difference in amplitude when referenced to the level at 90hz, 20dB , 19dB , and 17dB are all massive discrepancies in amplitude, and even a more conservative 15dB suggests a power multiplication factor of 32 which in-theory means if we are crossing over from our subwoofers to our tops around 80hz or 90hz our subwoofer system would need to handle 32 times more power than our PA tops (to make up for the 15db difference) if we want to play this sort of music at very high levels without our subwoofers running out of steam (headroom) before our tops reach their maximum output capability.

This of course suggests that we are going to need a heck of a lot of subwoofers to keep up with only one or two of our tops when playing such bass heavy music at very high levels, HOWEVER, It is true that we will need a lot of subwoofers for extreme SPL but not to worry as it is not quite as outlandish as our line of reasoning with this example suggests.  
As opposed to the figures given here our real-world is more forgiving in practice **More practical** 10 decibels is much closer to what we really need to make up for in the critical high SPL application, 10dB is a power multiplication factor of 10 (Easy to remember)

*Note that the the type of music you play, and at what level, and for how long, are all determining factors in this but the following ratio recommendations will be based on our "worst case" heavy-bass low Crest-Factor high SPL scenario discussed above.*

### RECOMMENDED CABINET RATIO GUIDE
---
**A way to figure out what you need is by following some rough Top-To-Subwoofer Ratio guidelines which are as follows:**  
A single Paraflex 1x12 top (G#1 STYLE) = 1:3 ratio if using Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers or a 1:2 ratio if using our Paraflex 1x21 or 2x15 subwoofers with recommended drivers. In other words if you are running a pair of these 1x12 tops you can have 6 of our Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers or 4 of our 1x21 (or 2x15) subwoofers which should bring you close enough to matching your available headroom.  

Paraflex 2x12 top = Referring to the ratios given above for the 1x12 you can double the amount of subwoofers when using the Paraflex 2x12 top.
Two of our Paraflex Type "A" 1x12 subwoofers loaded with recommended robust drivers are nearly equivalent to one of our Paraflex 1x18 subwoofers. 
Three of these Type "A" 1x12 subwoofers is nearly equivalent to 1 of our Paraflex 1x21 subwoofer cabinets or a Paraflex 2x15 subwoofer. The drivers which are used in these cabinets will of course make a difference so these ratios are only approximations.
Two of our Paraflex 1x15 subwoofers are equivalent-ish to a Paraflex 1x21 subwoofer (again the drivers used will influence this). 
The Paraflex 2x8 top loaded with capable 8" drivers will be nearly equivalent to the Paraflex 1x12 (G#1 style) Top. If high passed a bit higher it will gain some headroom, or when used with kickbins it will gain headroom.

So that covers the ratios, just know that they are not set in stone and they are not entirely precise but they are useful for the sake of guidance & perspective.
These ratios can assist you in making informed decisions when it comes to how you invest in your system as the matching of headroom means your money is more effectively spent due to the way you are intelligently allocating it. (highly important when resources are limited)


### BENDING THE CABINET RATIOS
---
If you would like to skew the ratios in a way which calls for a few less subwoofers in your system then you can certainly do this by choosing drivers with higher power handling capability for your subwoofer cabinets, or by choosing a Paraflex subwoofer cabinet design which employs multiple drivers. 
Generally speaking this means larger diameter voicecoils or it can mean more voicecoils per cabinet (or 18Sound's Tetracoil). A superb example of this (which has been built in multiples and is practical) would be the Paraflex C-2E 2x15 subwoofer loaded with dual 15DS115 drivers (there is an adaptation in which we shift the driver's baffles over slightly for the 15DS115s in order to give their pole vents a little more breathing room), it is a marvelous combination with tremendous power density for a Paraflex. 
A few less radical & less costly examples could be one of the NTL5000 drivers in the Silver Formula C-2E subwoofer or one of the 6" diameter coiled 21" drivers such as the NSW6021-6 or 21SW152 in the Silver Formula C-2E or Golden Formula C-2A 1x21.  

### LESS CAN BE MORE WHEN IT COMES TO PROCESSING
---
It is important to mention that Paraflex subwoofer systems tend to sound best and perform optimally with very little processing (or no processing at all, other than recommended High-Pass and Low-Pass filters) on the subwoofer channel.
In other words we recommend keeping the processing minimal which means that some of the classic hardware such as the BBE Sonic Maximizer or Aphex Aural Exciter are not needed and this is a great opportunity to simplify your amplifier rack (perhaps open up enough room for another amplifier).  

This recommendation is not only for the sake of improved sound quality but anything which takes away from the dynamics of your low frequency content while boosting the average level of low frequency energy in the vicinity of your subwoofer cabinet's fundamental tuning increases the potential for thermal buildup. 

This of course does not apply to what a DJ must do on their side when the occasional anemic sounding track is encountered and some fattening up of the track's bottom-end is required. This is acceptable since it is selectively applied and only when called for.

###  BE DILIGENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PREVENTION OF CLIPPING
---
This is a good place for mentioning how important it is to make sure none of the stages in your signal chain are being overloaded because if any component in your chain is pushed much too hard it becomes a source of clipped waveforms (flat topping) which as you should know are notorious for overheating voicecoils.  
If your DJ is blasting the mixer's output level meters into the red then you need to take action in order to prevent that from happening. Make up for it with additional gain in your system's latter stages if necessary. Keep a spray bottle or squirt gun handy so you can squirt the DJ every time they hit the reds as if you are training an unruly kitten. Be consistent, show no mercy!

###  LIMITERS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SET TO PROTECT A SUBWOOFER SYSTEM
---
 Last but not least limiters are an important topic and an essential feature if you want to do everything you can to protect your subwoofer system. 
 I understand that some trusted manufacturers such as Danley and Powersoft offer a lot of guidance in this area so it is definitely worth checking out their tutorials, explanations & formulas. 
 
 We will go over the most basic of basics here with a common 2 part limiter system consisting of both a Peak Stop Limiter and an RMS limiter, each having their own very specific function.The goal here is to control the average power levels while fully retaining & preserving the music's Crest Factor (dynamic nature), and the key to success is our settings.
 
 If your DSP limiter system is separate from your amplifier (not integrated) then this procedure can either be calculated or if you prefer the manual approach it will require a trusty A/C voltmeter and a tone generator set to 50hz or 60hz. Disconnect your speakers from the amplifier for this, and instead connect your A/C voltmeter to the amplifier's output (the channel which we wish to set the limiter for) Amp's gain pots set to fully clockwise.

The Peak Stop Limiter is much like the Clip Limiter feature which is included in many amplifiers, and it's purpose is simply to prevent your amplifier from clipping on peaks or if your amplifier is MASSIVELY overpowered for your driver the Peak Stop Limiter can be set up to protect your driver from mechanical damage. 

Modern heavy duty high excursion subwoofer drivers can withstand some absurdly high peaks so adjusting your threshold to set your peak power output level to the driver's "Program" or "Music Program" rating is reasonable, or if your amplifier doesn't have that much voltage output available you could set the Peak Stop Limiter's threshold to limit output closer to the driver's AES rating (some brands use the terms "RMS" or "Nominal" which are close enough to AES for our purposes. 
The Peak Stop Limiter's time constants should both be set extremely short practically instantaneous and the compression ratio should bet set very high (infinity or "brick wall"). 
 
**Our quest to make sense of it all**
It must be said that driver manufacturers do not all use the same standards for power handling nor do they use the same terminology. This can create some confusion or misinterpretation at times. Comparing the power handling ratings of drivers from two or more different brands is "Apples to Oranges" (meaning not precisely or scientifically comparable due to different standards).  

Good news is that we can gain a foothold in our quest to make sense of this by first having a basic understanding of what the AES 1984 Power Handling standard is all about so that we establish a reference to work from, and then from there we can bring everything into focus. This AES standard is determined by the driver surviving a 2 hour trial in free-air being fed a Pink Noise signal which is filtered to cover a decade of spectrum (so that could be from 20hz to 200hz for example) Pink Noise is dynamic and has a Crest Factor of 6db which is a vitally important detail to remember (6db is a power multiplication factor of 4). 

So this means that the actual conservative average component of this power handling is more along the lines of AES divided by 4  (again, remember this because we will be putting this information to work for us later). Now that we are familiar enough with how the AES power rating standard is defined the rest becomes easier because even though it is true that not all brands embrace this standard it is not a problem because the reputable ones which don't use AES will have their own alternative which comes close (off by no more than 30% it has been said, but usually less) and fortunately for us we don't need absolute precision to get this job done. 

You can look up the procedure that these other brands rely upon and you will find that well respected names like Eminence and B&C are also using filtered Pink-Noise over a few hours which explains why the ratings aren't too far removed from one another. Some brands prefer to call their power handling standard "RMS", others may call it  "Nominal", or they may have named it "Continuous" but all of these are roughly equivalent -ish to the AES standard.

**Musical program power ratings**
 Then there are "Program" or "Musical Program" power ratings which are basically AES+3dB (which is the same as double the AES rating since 3dB is a power multiplication factor of 2. We don't even need to concern ourselves with "Peak" ratings but they are derived from adding yet another +3dB).
 
There are other standards and terms out there but the ones we have mentioned here are those which you will encounter with modern PA drivers most often. So now that we have all of that covered it has laid the foundation for us to delve into your DSP's RMS Limiter settings.

**RMS limiting**

The RMS Limiter is something which we intend to set up to behave like an intentionally slow "leveler" or AGC circuit, and it's very long time constants are what makes it possible to retain our music's vital Crest Factor. In order to accomplish this you will need find your RMS limiter's Attack and Release settings and Ratio if available (these Time Constant settings are sometimes labeled with different names). 

Set the Attack timing very long at 2000ms to 3000ms (2 to 3 seconds). 
Then set your Release (or sometimes called "Decay") time at least 2x the attack time (or some prefer higher, as much as 4x to 6x).  
The limiter's Ratio setting (if available) should be turned high to at least 6:1 up to 10:1 or more.  

Keep in mind that we are creating a very slow limiter which intentionally does not respond to peaks,  and considering our AES (or AES equivalent) is determined with a Pink Noise signal that has a 6db Crest Factor (factor of 4) just imagine the component of the signal which remains if the dynamics were removed from the Pink Noise, this leaves us with a signal level approximating 1/4 (25%) of our AES (or equivalent) power rating, and that will be our most "safe" & bulletproof target option for our subwoofer system's RMS limiter. 

**Amplifier voltage & average power handling**

So for the last step in this limiter setting procedure we want to once again drive the system with our full strength signal and begin adjusting the limiter's Threshold setting while watching our A/C voltmeter until output hits our measured target voltage which correlates with 1/4 (25%) of the driver's AES (or equivalent) rating.
Once achieved you should then stop the signal,  disconnect the volt meter, hook your speakers back up and proceed to play your favorite music at party volumes for a a few hours (or even play a gig) to determine if the driver's motors are becoming hot to the touch and if not that is great news because it means you can run the procedure again and this time adjust your RMS Limiter's Threshold setting until your measured amplifier output voltage correlates with 1/3rd (33%) of the driver's AES (or equivalent rating). 

Again, once achieved stop the signal, disconnect the meter, reconnect speakers, and test with music again at war volume for at least a few hours to determine motor heat buildup and if your subwoofers are still running acceptably cool then that is fantastic because it means our next Threshold setting to try would be 1/2 (50%) of AES (or equivalent) So on and so forth.

If the driver's motor ever feels uncomfortably hot to the touch then you are surely experiencing Thermal Power Compression losses at that point which is not ideal, and is a sign to back off on the average power levels. If the outside of the motor is hot then the inside of the motor is even hotter. If you would prefer to be extra nerdy about it you can always contact the manufacturer of the driver to ask about what they suggest for maximum operating temperature (as measured at the magnet structure or wherever they recommend) and then a Thermal Gun (Infrared Thermometer) can be used to check.

The reason for the differing in averaged power handling (as a % of AES) from system to system (and situation to situation) revolves around many variables, some of which we already went over such as characteristics of music style and how it interacts with the cabinet design,  duration of show, and dissimilarity in ratings systems (some drivers will be rated more optimistically than others).  Even ambient temperature and humidity will have some influence.

*NOTE: To calculate the voltage which correlates with your desired long term power limit you must first multiply that wattage figure by the nominal ohm impedance load and then find the square root of that product.  If you prefer a calculator [here is a link](www.calculator.net/ohms-law-calculator.html).*

As an example: 117v is 1700w into 8 ohms nominal and 82v is about 850 watts into 8 ohms nominal , while half of 117v or 58.5v is 425 watts into 8 ohms nominal. **Notice that half the voltage works out to 1/4 (25%) of the power in watts.** Mr. Mark Tomlin of Linea Research (and also happens to be our HOQS Regional Support Director for The UK) suggests the Linea Research method for determining your RMS limiter attack time. He noted:  *"100/HPF frequency.  So if you have a high pass at 45hz it would be 100/45=2.22. Then set the release at 2 or 3 times the attack depending how much protection you want"*.

*NOTE: If instead of milliseconds your limiter's time constants go by dB/s then DON'T PANIC because converting is just a simple matter of dividing 3250 by the time in ms. Thus 10ms attack time ~= 325dB/s. 4ms attack time ~= 800dB/s*
